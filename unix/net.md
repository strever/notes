The alert() function is not specified in the original PAC specification, although support was previously supported in several browsers, useful for outputting the value of a variable or result of a function in a manner that is viewable by the end-user and leveraged for troubleshooting PAC file rule issues.

This function is now considered unsupported and non-functional in PAC files.
